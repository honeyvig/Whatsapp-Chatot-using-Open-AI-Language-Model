# Whatsapp-Chatot-using-Open-AI-Language-Model
Here’s a Python implementation to create a WhatsApp chatbot using OpenAI's Language Model (via openai API) integrated with Twilio for seamless communication:
1. Install Required Libraries

Install the necessary libraries:

pip

 install openai twilio flask

2. Flask App Setup

Create a Flask application to handle incoming WhatsApp messages and respond.

from flask import Flask, request
from twilio.twiml.messaging_response import MessagingResponse
import openai
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

# OpenAI API Key
openai.api_key = "your-openai-api-key"

# Twilio Account Credentials
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = "your-twilio-account-sid"
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = "your-twilio-auth-token"

# Support ticket endpoint (example)
SUPPORT_TICKET_API_URL = "https://example.com/api/tickets"

def generate_response(user_message):
    """Generate response using OpenAI GPT model."""
    try:
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # Use the desired OpenAI model
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful customer support assistant."},
                {"role": "user", "content": user_message},
            ],
            max_tokens=300,
        )
        return response['choices'][0]['message']['content'].strip()
    except Exception as e:
        return "Sorry, I couldn't process your request. Please try again later."

def create_support_ticket(user_message, user_number):
    """Create a support ticket using an external API."""
    payload = {
        "user_number": user_number,
        "message": user_message
    }
    try:
        response = requests.post(SUPPORT_TICKET_API_URL, json=payload)
        if response.status_code == 201:
            return "Your support ticket has been created successfully. Our team will get back to you shortly."
        else:
            return "Failed to create a support ticket. Please try again later."
    except Exception as e:
        return "There was an error creating the support ticket. Please contact support directly."

@app.route("/whatsapp", methods=["POST"])
def whatsapp_webhook():
    """Handle incoming WhatsApp messages."""
    incoming_message = request.form.get('Body')
    sender_number = request.form.get('From')
    response = MessagingResponse()

    if "support ticket" in incoming_message.lower():
        # Generate a support ticket
        ticket_response = create_support_ticket(incoming_message, sender_number)
        response.message(ticket_response)
    else:
        # Generate a response using OpenAI
        ai_response = generate_response(incoming_message)
        response.message(ai_response)

    return str(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

3. Configure Twilio WhatsApp Integration

    Setup Twilio:
        Create a Twilio account and enable WhatsApp Business API.
        Configure your Twilio number for WhatsApp messaging.

    Webhook Configuration:
        In Twilio's console, set the Incoming Message Webhook URL to the Flask app endpoint (e.g., https://your-domain.com/whatsapp).

4. Features Breakdown
Answer Questions

The chatbot uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate responses for general queries. The user’s query is passed to the generate_response function, which interacts with OpenAI’s API.
Generate Support Tickets

If a message contains keywords like "support ticket," the bot calls the create_support_ticket function, which posts user data to the external support ticketing API.
Twilio WhatsApp Integration

Incoming messages from WhatsApp are handled via Twilio’s webhook, and replies are sent back using MessagingResponse.
5. Testing the Chatbot

    Run the Flask App Locally:

python app.py

Expose Locally Hosted App: Use a tool like ngrok to expose your Flask app publicly:

    ngrok http 5000

    Set Webhook in Twilio: Point Twilio's webhook to your ngrok URL, e.g., https://<ngrok-id>.ngrok.io/whatsapp.

    Send a WhatsApp Message: Test the chatbot by sending messages to your Twilio WhatsApp number.

6. Additional Considerations

    Language Support: Use OpenAI's multilingual capabilities to support other languages if needed.
    Message Logs: Save incoming and outgoing messages to a database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB) for analytics and auditing.
    Scalability: Deploy the Flask app on AWS (Elastic Beanstalk) or Azure for production readiness.

This implementation serves as a foundation for further enhancement
